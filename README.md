# Sentiment_analysis
Sentiment Analysis is to detect the polarity of text in consideration in textual form. It is also known as opinion mining as it derives
the opinion of the speaker or the user about some topic. In other words, it determines whether a piece of writing is positive, negative
or neutral. For example, do people on Twitter think that prime minister Shri Narendra Modi is doing his job properly or not? To find 
out the answer we can refer the social networking site twitter. There are millions of opinions of people about Shri Narendra Modi, some
of them positive and some will be negative or neutral. We can get the exact ideas of why people think Modi Ji is fulfilling his 
responsibilities or not, by extracting the exact word indicating the positive or negative opinion. 

It can be carried out at various levels like document level, phrase level or sentence level. When the sentence consists of positive as
well as negative sentiments at word level, the whole sentence becomes neutral at sentence level. As the sentiment analysis on twitter 
or any social media site tracks particular topic, many politicians as well as companies use twitter to track their position in politics
and monitor their products and services respectively. The major benefit of sentiment analysis in previous work was to find out whether
the expressed opinion in the document or sentence is positive, negative or neutral. But it was not useful in decision making as no reasons
were known about why the sentiments has changed. Hence there was need to build a system for interpreting the public sentiment variations.
